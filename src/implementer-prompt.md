Round context:

{{ROUND_CONTEXT}}

Rules:

- Work only in the current Sandcastle worktree and only on this issue.
- Read relevant source and tests before editing. The current base checkout is authoritative: do not infer a missing feature from an old integration branch name or from comparing the base to an earlier branch snapshot.
- Implement the simplest coherent solution that satisfies the ticket. Prefer existing code and patterns over new abstractions.
- Add focused regression tests for demonstrated failures, then run relevant checks. Do not invent remote acceptance evidence.
- Commit all new implementation/correction changes. On the first round, a pre-existing candidate already committed ahead of the base SHA may be reused **only after inspecting its actual diff and passing appropriate tests**; do not manufacture empty/no-op commits. All correction rounds must produce a new commit.
- Before claiming a repository prerequisite is missing, verify it **at current HEAD** with `git rev-parse HEAD`, relevant `git show HEAD:<path>` or source/symbol searches, and `git merge-base --is-ancestor <prerequisite-sha> HEAD` when a prerequisite commit is known. The fact that a historical integration branch has differences from the current base does **not** prove the feature is missing. Give concrete command results in the blocker reason.
- If truly unable to complete, report `blocked` for a verified missing prerequisite or `failed` for an implementation failure, with a concrete reason and the actual current HEAD. Never claim `completed` without a committed candidate ahead of the expected previous HEAD.
- Do not push, merge, close/comment/edit issues, or mutate GitHub state.
- Do not access or print credentials.
- Do not launch hidden subagents or another Sandcastle workflow.
- The controller, not this session, owns final acceptance.

At the end, you MUST execute `echo $CODEX_THREAD_ID`, `git rev-parse HEAD`, and `date -u` in the terminal to get the real values before writing your response. Do not hallucinate or invent the session_id; you must read the environment variable. Return only JSON matching the supplied schema:

- phase: `implementer`
- status: `completed`, `blocked`, or `failed`
- issue_number: {{ISSUE_NUMBER}}
- session_id: exact `CODEX_THREAD_ID`
- head: actual current HEAD SHA (new commit, or verified existing candidate commit on the initial round)
- completed_at: UTC timestamp
- reason: empty string for `completed`; specific non-empty explanation for `blocked` or `failed`

If implementation, tests, or commit fails, report the truthful status instead of fabricating success. The controller will preserve the receipt and defer this ticket for the remainder of the run.
