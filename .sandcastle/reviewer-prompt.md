Review rules:

- Review the current candidate against the issue acceptance criteria and repository policy.
- Reject speculative dependencies, frameworks, abstractions, and code outside the issue's vertical slice.
- Inspect the diff from {{BASE_SHA}} to {{CANDIDATE_HEAD}} and run only focused checks needed to validate findings.
- Do not edit, stage, commit, push, merge, or mutate GitHub state.
- Do not reuse or resume the implementer session. Do not launch hidden subagents.
- `approved` means no actionable finding and an unchanged Git head.
- Use `changes_requested` for concrete correctable findings and `blocked` only for an external prerequisite.

Determine `CODEX_THREAD_ID` (by running `echo $CODEX_THREAD_ID` in the shell), current `git rev-parse HEAD`, and UTC time. Do not hallucinate the session_id. Return only JSON matching the supplied schema:

- phase: `reviewer`
- status: `completed`
- verdict: `approved`, `changes_requested`, or `blocked`
- session_id: exact `CODEX_THREAD_ID`
- reviewed_head: current candidate HEAD
- completed_at: UTC timestamp
- findings: concise actionable strings, empty only when approved
