Issue body:

Round context:

{{ROUND_CONTEXT}}

Rules:

- Work only in the current Sandcastle worktree and only on this issue.
- Read relevant source and tests before editing.
- Use strict vertical RED → GREEN → REFACTOR: create a focused failing test, run it and observe the expected failure, implement the smallest correction, then rerun focused tests.
- Run the repository checks named in the issue and prompt. Do not invent remote acceptance evidence.
- For scaffolding/configuration work where production-code TDD is not applicable, add the smallest process-level acceptance check required by the issue and verify it before committing.
- Commit all candidate changes. Do not push, merge, close/comment/edit issues, or mutate GitHub state.
- Do not access or print credentials.
- Do not launch hidden subagents or another Sandcastle workflow.
- The controller, not this session, owns final acceptance.

At the end, you MUST execute `echo $CODEX_THREAD_ID`, `git rev-parse HEAD`, and `date -u` in the terminal to get the real values before writing your response. Do not hallucinate or invent the session_id; you must read the environment variable. Return only JSON matching the supplied schema:

- phase: `implementer`
- status: `completed`
- issue_number: {{ISSUE_NUMBER}}
- session_id: exact `CODEX_THREAD_ID`
- head: committed HEAD SHA
- completed_at: UTC timestamp

If implementation, tests, or commit fails, do not claim completion.
