description: Start and supervise the repo-local Ralph orchestrator in AFK mode. Use when an agent should execute ready GitHub tickets through the Ralph workflow, choose explicit Codex harness/model/effort routing for implementer/reviewer/merger, monitor the orchestrator and all Herdr execution surfaces it owns, and perform coarse whole-run recovery only when the run is genuinely unhealthy.

# Ralph AFK Operator

Operate the repository's Ralph orchestrator. Do not reimplement its scheduler, ticket selection, review loop, or merge policy.

## Start

1. Load/use the `herdr` skill before inspecting or controlling Herdr.
2. Work from the target repository and verify `HERDR_ENV=1`.
3. Confirm no Ralph orchestrator already owns the repository. Do not start a second one.
4. Choose the harness, model, and effort explicitly for all three roles. V1 supports `codex` only; `claude-code` and `pi` are reserved startup values for later implementation.
5. Run preflight first, then start the same command without `--preflight`.
6. Keep the orchestrator itself in a visible Herdr terminal. The orchestrator creates visible owned Herdr panes for implementers, reviewers, correction implementers, and mergers.

Example (set `IMPLEMENTER_MODEL`, `REVIEWER_MODEL`, and `MERGER_MODEL` to actually available Codex model IDs first):

```bash
npm run ralph:check -- \
  --implementer-harness codex --implementer-model "$IMPLEMENTER_MODEL" --implementer-effort high \
  --reviewer-harness codex --reviewer-model "$REVIEWER_MODEL" --reviewer-effort medium \
  --merger-harness codex --merger-model "$MERGER_MODEL" --merger-effort high \
  --max-parallel 3

npm run ralph -- \
  --implementer-harness codex --implementer-model "$IMPLEMENTER_MODEL" --implementer-effort high \
  --reviewer-harness codex --reviewer-model "$REVIEWER_MODEL" --reviewer-effort medium \
  --merger-harness codex --merger-model "$MERGER_MODEL" --merger-effort high \
  --max-parallel 3
```

Use repository-appropriate `--focused-test`, `--final-test`, and `--integration-test` overrides when the defaults are not valid.

## Monitor

Inspect the orchestrator terminal and owned Herdr panes on a bounded cadence: 15 minutes initially; after successive checks without material progress, wait 30, then 60, then 120 minutes (cap at 120). A new commit, completed review round, changed acceptance state, or finished ticket resets the next interval to 15 minutes. Process exit or a `needs_triage` result should be handled on the next observation, not left waiting for owner approval.

Treat these as normal and do nothing:
- ticket-local worker/test/review failures while the orchestrator keeps progressing;
- a failed, blocked, or merger-rejected ticket being deferred for the rest of the current run;
- a ticket paused at 20 review rounds while independent tickets continue;
- healthy long-running agent output;
- successful sibling tickets continuing after another ticket fails.

Look for evidence of a genuinely unhealthy run:
- the orchestrator itself is dead or frozen while work remains;
- an owned worker is clearly frozen and indefinitely prevents the current iteration from settling;
- multiple owned Codex sessions show shared 429/quota exhaustion;
- Herdr/process ownership is inconsistent enough that safe progress cannot continue.

Do not infer failure from an idle-looking badge alone. Read terminal output and process/session evidence. A normal `complete_with_failures` or `complete_with_triage` result ends the run and needs an owner-facing summary, **not** an automatic restart. A future run may intentionally reconsider open tickets.

## Recover

Prefer coarse recovery over clever repair in v1.

When the run is genuinely unhealthy:
1. Stop the one owned orchestrator.
2. Stop/close only Herdr surfaces that carry the same `RALPH_RUN_ID`.
3. Confirm the old orchestrator is gone and its repo lock is no longer live.
4. If the evidence suggests quota or a transient provider condition, wait/back off before retrying.
5. Restart exactly one orchestrator with the same explicit harness/model/effort routing.

Do not restart one ticket with a second orchestrator. Do not build phase-level resume logic. Open GitHub issues are intentionally eligible to run again after a whole-run restart.

## Triage

When a ticket hits the 20-round review limit, read its `needs-triage.json` and existing review receipts. Summarize repeated failed ACs, follow-ups, and the likely design/implementation mismatch. Send the owner a concise recommendation or save a Markdown review artifact. Do not silently change acceptance criteria, create backlog issues, or wait for human approval; let other ready tickets continue. The paused issue stays open for an owner decision.

## Finish

When the orchestrator exits because no runnable ticket remains:
- verify there are no still-owned active Herdr agents;
- stop any monitoring/cron created for this run;
- report the final outcome, failed/blocked issues and their receipts, meaningful non-blocking follow-ups from ticket results, triage summaries, and any tickets left open. Recommend which follow-ups merit backlog consideration; never create tickets or wait for owner approval.
